### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 1,911 Vine reviews that were 5 stars and 46,599 non-Vine reviews that were 5 stars.

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
40% of the Vine reviews were five stars; 46% of the non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary
Given that the 5 star reviews generated by the Vine program are actually lower than the reviews generated outside the program, there does not appear to be a bias for favorable reviews apparent in the Vine data.  An additional analysis could make use of machine learning to perform sentimental analysis to get a broader sense of how favorability is distributed across sets.  We could also broaden the analysis by looking at 4 and 5 star reviews as positive, 3 stars as neutral, and 1 and 2 stars as negative to get a fuller picture of the favorability distribution.
